Changes from sophimail description

The pkg postfix binary package does not have mysql support, so instead of installing that package
we use portsnap to grab the ports tree and build postfix from source.  The configuration that is used
places postfix in /etc/postfix rather than /usr/local/etc/postfix.  I prefer this as it saves me typing.
PostgresSQL support is also included in the postfix build.  I prefer Postgres over Mysql, so eventually
I will migrate all of the configs off of Mysql so that I don't have to manage the Mysql configuration.

All of the configuration files from the sophimail description are contained in the templates tree.  These
files have been made into Jinja2 templates and the packer.sh script runs jinja2 on these templates to populate
the files directory.  The packer script copys the files directory to the newly installed OS in its entirety.

The script_templates tree has scripts that are also templatized for jinja2.  These get expanded into the scripts
directory.  The packer config runs through a list of sripts that install software can copy configuration into
place.  The goal is that would the working image is complete that all of the software will be installed and 
configuration put in place, and the system should be operational.
